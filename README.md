# Seth Jeffery's personal website

This website can be downloaded for a simple front-end tech demo. It does not need any server-side technology as it compiles straight to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

## Setup

First run `bundle` to install the few necessary gems (Compass, Unicorn and HAML).

Now run `grunt` to build the site and start the web server. You can then view it at http://0.0.0.0:8080

If you just want to build without serving, run `grunt build`.
